Generate, inspect, and view Minecraft Java worlds.

## Overview

With CubiomesKit, you can create and inspect Minecraft Java worlds
programmatically in your macOS, iOS, and iPadOS apps. It leverages the
[Cubiomes](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes) library to facilitate
generation, searches, and rendering map images.

CubiomesKit also supports integration with MapKit to display interactive
maps, with support for AppKit/UIKit and SwiftUI.

> Important: At this time, only worlds generated in Minecraft Java Edition
> are supported.
